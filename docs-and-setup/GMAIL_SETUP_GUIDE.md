# Email Setup Guide for Valetez (GoDaddy/SecureServer)

## 📧 Setting up tech@growmoreparking.com for Email Sending

### Your Email Provider: GoDaddy (secureserver.net)

Since you're using tech@growmoreparking.com hosted on GoDaddy/SecureServer, here's the simple setup:

### Step 1: Get Your Email Password

You already have this! It's the same password you use to login to your email at:
- **Webmail:** https://email.secureserver.net
- Or through Outlook/other email clients

### Step 2: Add to .env File

Edit `backend/.env`:

```env
# Email Configuration (GoDaddy/SecureServer)
EMAIL_HOST=smtpout.secureserver.net
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_USER=tech@growmoreparking.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_actual_email_password
EMAIL_FROM=tech@growmoreparking.com
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Valetez Parking
```

**That's it! No App Passwords or 2FA needed.**

### Step 3: Test Email

Run the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

You should see:
```
✓ Email Service initialized
```

Create a booking and emails will send!

## 📊 GoDaddy Email Limits

| Limit Type | GoDaddy Email |
|------------|---------------|
| **Emails per day** | 250-1000 (depends on plan) |
| **Rate limit** | ~100/hour |
| **Attachment size** | 20 MB |

**For Valetez:**
- 100 bookings/day = 400 emails/day ✅ (within limit for most plans)
- If you hit limits, contact GoDaddy to increase

## ⚙️ GoDaddy SMTP Settings

**Primary (Recommended):**
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtpout.secureserver.net
EMAIL_PORT=465
```

**Alternative (if 465 doesn't work):**
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtpout.secureserver.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
```

Both work, but 465 (SSL) is more secure.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" error
- ✅ Verify EMAIL_USER is exactly: `tech@growmoreparking.com`
- ✅ Use your actual email password (same as webmail login)
- ✅ Check password has no extra spaces

### "Connection timeout" error
- Try PORT 587 instead of 465
- Check firewall isn't blocking SMTP

### Emails going to spam
- ✅ GoDaddy emails have good reputation
- ✅ SPF/DKIM records auto-configured by GoDaddy
- ✅ Rarely goes to spam

### "Too many emails" error
- You hit daily limit
- Wait 24 hours or contact GoDaddy support
- Upgrade to higher plan if needed
